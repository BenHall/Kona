This is a sample application created by TekPub.

I (Ben Hall) have taken this sample and used the base as a sample to explain how to Test ASP.net Web Applications using Ruby.

For each presentation, I have created a branch and a tag. As a result, you can download the source code from the Downloads tab as a zip, instead of having to use Git.

Any questions, please send me a message.

Thanks

Ben
